1) Do messages through Server.network.Connection and do it via the listener. 
	When a message is to be sent just send a changeEvent and Connection will handle it
	and send the message through Client.sendMessage(message) for all connected clients


2) Remember we need to keep everything updated on all Clients so when a change occurs it needs to
	be pushed to all affected connected Clients
